[QuickCarpet](https://github.com/QuickCarpet/QuickCarpet) extension mod which attempts to fix as many vanilla minecraft bugs as possible!
This Mod is a port of [Carpet-Fixes](https://github.com/fxmorin/carpet-fixes) although for [QuickCarpet](https://github.com/QuickCarpet/QuickCarpet) instead of [Fabric Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)

If you enjoy the mod, help me out by giving this project a star, thanks.

## Settings

The port does not have a proper settings list. Although [This List](https://github.com/fxmorin/carpet-fixes/wiki/Available-Settings/b397d6736467b9701cad378beba84d3970867784) should give you a good idea.
Although many fixes are either not in the port or QuickCarpet has its own rule for it instead! The majority are in the port tho

## More detail
This mod works for both Singleplayer & Multiplayer, although it only modifies server-side functionality!

I will most likely not update this mod, since I am currently working on the successor of [Carpet-Fixes](https://github.com/fxmorin/carpet-fixes) that will have [QuickCarpet](https://github.com/QuickCarpet/QuickCarpet) support built-in
