    /**
     * Sculk sensor has a directional bias when it comes to wool occlusion. This is due the raycast going at a perfect
     * 45 degree, which means that when it hits the corner of 2 blocks at the same time, it is only able to pick one.
     * This fix could be integrated directly into the world raycast, performance changes are unnoticeable.
     *
     * How it works:
     * We simply check if both the X & Z offsets are the same (abs), if they are it means that this is a perfect
     * diagonal (45 degree angle). In which case, we can later do a secondary check if on the second block by flipping
     * the X & Z offsets. Since this only happens on 45 degree angles, switching X & Z will not cause any issues!
